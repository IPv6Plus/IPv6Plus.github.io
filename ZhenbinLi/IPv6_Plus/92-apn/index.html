<p>Description:</p>

<p>Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better
   network services for users.  As the ever developing 5G and industrial
   verticals evolve, more and more services that have diverse network
   requirements such as ultra-low latency and high reliability are
   emerging, and therefore differentiated service treatment is desired
   by users.  However, network operators are typically unaware of which
   applications are traversing their network infrastructure, which means
   that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users.  As a
   result, network operators are only evolving their infrastructure to
   be large but dumb pipes without corresponding revenue increases that
   might be enabled by differentiated service treatment.  As network
   technologies evolve including deployments of IPv6, SRv6, Segment
   Routing over MPLS dataplane, the programmability provided by IPv6 and
   Segment Routing can be augmented by conveying application related
   information into the network.  Adding application knowledge to the
   network layer allows applications to specify finer granularity
   requirements to the network operator.</p>

<p><strong>2. Application-aware Networking (APN) Framework</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2020-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-apn-framework-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-apn-framework-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some new emerging applications (e.g. 5G) have very
   demanding performance requirements.  However, in current networks,
   the network and applications are decoupled, that is, the network is
   not aware of the applications’ requirements in a fine granularity.
   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity traffic
   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.</p>

<p>This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware
   Networking (APN), where application characteristic information such
   as application identification and its network performance
   requirements is carried in the packet encapsulation in order to
   facilitate service provisioning, perform application-level traffic
   steering and network resource adjustment.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use cases of Application-aware Networking (APN) in Edge Computing</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2020-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-liu-apn-edge-usecase-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-liu-apn-edge-usecase-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The ever-emerging new services are imposing more and more highly
   demanding requirements on the network.  However, the current
   deployments could not fully accommodate those requirements due to
   limited capabilities.  For example, it is difficult to utilize the
   traditional centralized deployment mode to meet the low-latency
   demand of some latency-sensitive applications.  Moreover, the total
   amount of centralized service data is growing exponentially, which
   brings great pressure on the network bandwidth.  There has been a
   clear trend that decentralized sites comprising of computing and
   storage resources are deployed at various locations to provide
   services.  In particular, when the sites are deployed at the network
   edge, i.e. the Edge Computing, it can better handle the business
   needs of the users nearby, which provides the possibilities to
   provide differentiated network and computing services.  In order to
   achieve the full benefits of the edge computing, it actually implies
   a precondition that the network should be aware of the applications’
   requirements in order to steer their traffic to the network paths
   that can satisfy their requirements.  Application-aware networking
   (APN) fits as the missing puzzle piece to bridge the applications and
   the network to accommodate the edge services’ needs, fully releasing
   the benefits of the edge computing.</p>

<p>This document describes the various application scenarios in edge
   computing to which the APN can be beneficial, including augmented
   reality, cloud gaming and remote control, which empowers the video
   business, users interaction business and user-device interaction
   business.  In those scenarios, APN can identify the specific
   requirements of edge computing applications on the network, process
   close to the users, provide SLA guaranteed network services such as
   low latency and high reliability.</p>

<p><strong>4. Application-aware IPv6 Networking</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2019-07</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-6man-app-aware-ipv6-network-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-6man-app-aware-ipv6-network-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video
   streaming have very demanding network requirements thereof require
   special treatments in the network.  However, in current networks, the
   network and applications are decoupled, that is, the network is not
   aware of the applications’ requirements in a finer granularity.
   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granular traffic
   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.</p>

<p>This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6
   Networking, and also the solution to guarantee SLA for applications,
   which makes use of IPv6 extensions header in order to convey the
   application related information including its requirements along with
   the packet to the network so to facilitate the service deployment and
   network resources adjustment.  Then, it defines the application-aware
   options which can be used in the different IPv6 extension headers for
   the purpose.</p>
