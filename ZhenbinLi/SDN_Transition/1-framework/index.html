<p><strong>1. Usecases of MPLS Global Label</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-07</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-mpls-global-label-usecases-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-mpls-global-label-usecases-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>As the SDN(Service-Driven Network) technology develops, MPLS global
   label has been proposed again for new solutions.  The document
   proposes possible usecases of MPLS global label.  MPLS global label
   can be used for identification of the location, the service and the
   network in different application scenarios.  From these usecases we
   can see that no matter SDN or traditional application scenarios, the
   new solutions based on MPLS global label can gain advantage over the
   existing solutions to facilitate service provisions.</p>

<p><strong>3. Framework of Network Virtualization Based on MPLS Global Label</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide
   better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service
   provision.  In the past years, MPLS plays a key role in the process
   of implementing network virtualization.  This document introduces a
   new framework to implement network virtualization based on MPLS
   global label.  It can provide the virtualized network topology, nodes
   and links using MPLS global label which can make up the virtual
   network.</p>

<p><strong>4. Comparison between Segment Routing and LDP/RSVP-TE</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2016-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-compare-sr-ldp-rsvpte-01">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-compare-sr-ldp-rsvpte-01</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Segment Routing has been proposed to cope with the use cases in
   traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  This
   document is to compare Segment Routing with the existing LDP and
   RSVP-TE.  Through the comparison the challenges are clarified for the
   Segment Routing when deploy in the existing MPLS network.</p>

<p><strong>5. Multi-domain MPLS Deployment Enhancement</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-xu-mpls-multi-domain-deployment-enhancement-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-xu-mpls-multi-domain-deployment-enhancement-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale
   networks which consists of multiple domains (e.g., IGP areas/levels
   and even Autonomous Systems). To scale such multi-domain MPLS
   deployment, the concept of hierarchical LSPs is usually resorted.
   This document describes an enhancement to such hierarchical multi-
   domain MPLS deployment architecture that could further improve the
   scalability of multi-domain MPLS deployment.</p>

<p><strong>6. MPLS Segment Routing over IP</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF RFC</p>

<p>Publication History: 2019-12</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8663">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8663</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) is a method of source routing a packet
   through an MPLS data plane by imposing a stack of MPLS labels on the
   packet to specify the path together with any packet-specific
   instructions to be executed on it.  SR-MPLS can be leveraged to
   realize a source-routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data
   planes by using an MPLS label stack as a source-routing instruction
   set while making no changes to SR-MPLS specifications and
   interworking with SR-MPLS implementations.</p>

<p>This document describes how SR-MPLS-capable routers and IP-only
   routers can seamlessly coexist and interoperate through the use of
   SR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-
   over-UDP as defined in RFC 7510.</p>

<p><strong>7. Use Cases and Framework of Service-Oriented MPLS Path Programming (MPP)</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2015-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-mpls-path-programming-01">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-mpls-path-programming-01</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture for unicast
   traffic has been proposed to cope with the use cases in traffic
   engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  It can leverage
   existing MPLS dataplane without any modification.  In fact, the label
   stack capability in MPLS would have been utilized well to implement
   flexible path programming to satisfy all kinds of requirements of
   service bearing.  But in the distributed environment, the flexible
   programming capability is difficult to implement and always confined
   to reachability.  As the introducing of central control in the
   network, the flexible MPLS programming capability becomes possible
   owing to two factors: 1.  It becomes easier to allocate label for
   more purposes than reachability; 2.  It is easy to calculate the MPLS
   path in a global network view.  Moreover, the MPLS path programming
   capability can be utilized to satisfy more requirements of service
   bearing in the service layer which is defined as service-oriented
   MPLS path programming.  This document defines the concept of MPLS
   path programming, then proposes use cases, architecture and protocol
   extension requirements in the service layer for the architecture of
   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING).</p>

<p><strong>8. Segment Path Programming (SPP)</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2015-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-segment-path-programming-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-spring-segment-path-programming-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Segment Routing for unicast traffic has been proposed to cope with
   the usecases in traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain,
   etc.  The document generalizes more use cases based on segment and
   proposes the concept of Segment Path Programming.  In the field of
   Segment Path Programming: 1.  The Segment used in the programmed
   segment path is not only used in the forwarding plane, but also used
   in the control plane. 2.  The programmed segment path is not only
   used in the transport layer, but also used in the service layer.
   Accordingly this document proposes use cases, architecture and
   protocol extension requirements for the Segment Path Programming
   (SPP).</p>

<p><strong>1. An Architecture of Central Controlled Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-rtgwg-cc-igp-arch-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-rtgwg-cc-igp-arch-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>As the Software Defined Networks (SDN) solution develops, IGP will be
   extended to support central control.  This document introduces an
   architecture of using IGP for central controlling.  Some use cases
   under this new framework are also discussed.  For specific use cases,
   making necessary extensions in IGP are required.</p>

<p><strong>2. Requirements of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for Central Control</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2014-07</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-rtgwg-igp-cc-reqs-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-rtgwg-igp-cc-reqs-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS or OSPF is a fundamental
   building block for traditional routing system which is based on
   distributed computation model.  Routing in networks based on
   centralized computation model such as Software Defined Network(SDN)
   may require special IGP extension to facilitate its operation in
   multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.</p>

<p>This document introduces an architecture of deploying IGP for
   central-controlled network, but it does not aim to provide a detailed
   description of all the architectural components.  It also specifies a
   set of functional requirements which can be fulfilled by IGP with
   proper extension for the central-controlled network.</p>

<p><strong>3. An Architecture of Central Controlled Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-idr-cc-bgp-arch-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-idr-cc-bgp-arch-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>As the Software Defined Networks (SDN) solution develops, BGP is
   extended to support central control.  This document introduces an
   architecture of using BGP for central controlling.  Some use cases
   under this new framework are also discussed.  For specific use cases,
   making necessary extensions in BGP are required.</p>

<p><strong>4. Architecture for Use of BGP as Central Controller</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2019-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cth-rtgwg-bgp-control-03">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cth-rtgwg-bgp-control-03</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>BGP is a core part of a network including Software-Defined Networking
   (SDN) system.  It has the traffic engineering information on the
   network topology and can compute optimal paths for a given traffic
   flow across the network.</p>

<p>This document describes some reference architectures for BGP as a
   central controller.  A BGP-based central controller can simplify the
   operations on the network and use network resources efficiently for
   providing services with high quality.</p>

<p><strong>5. The Use Cases for Path Computation Element (PCE) as a Central Controller</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  WG Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2020-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases-05">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases-05</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of a Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) system.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.  PCE was developed to
   derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied
   to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP).</p>

<p>SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing (SR), Service
   Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched
   network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control
   protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully
   enabled as a central controller.</p>

<p>This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment
   and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its
   challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCEP
   extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate
   documents.</p>

<p>This is a living document to catalogue the use cases for PCECC.
   There is currently no intention to publish this work as an RFC.</p>

<p><strong>6. An Architecture for Use of PCE and the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) in a Network with Central Control</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  RFC</p>

<p>Publication History: 2017-12</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8283">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8283</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.</p>

<p>PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).</p>

<p>SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
   (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range
   of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function
   Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network.  It
   is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for
   use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a
   central controller.</p>

<p>This document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a
   central controller, examines the motivations and applicability for
   PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the
   implications for the protocol.  A PCE-based central controller can
   simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it
   with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it.</p>

<p>This document does not describe use cases in detail and does not
   define protocol extensions: that work is left for other documents.</p>

<p><strong>7. An Architecture of Central Controlled Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN)</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2013-10</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-l2vpn-ccvpn-arch-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-l2vpn-ccvpn-arch-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>With the emergence of Software Defined Networks (SDN), the
   architecture of forwarding and control element separation will
   develop faster.  In the central controlled framework, control
   functionality of L2VPN can be done only by the Controllers.
   Consequently it can reduce control functionality in network nodes.
   This document defines the architecture of central controlled L2VPN
   and corresponding protocol extension requirement.</p>

<p><strong>1. Requirements and Architecture of Carrier IP Service Models</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF  Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2017-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-opsawg-carrier-ip-service-model-req-arch-01">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-opsawg-carrier-ip-service-model-req-arch-01</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller’s
   North-Bound Interface (NBI).  Defining a service model for different
   multi-layered and heterogeneous networks is a complicated work and
   may require lots of consideration since different model users may
   have different perspective and concerns.</p>

<p>This document proposes the requirements and architecture for service
   models to facilitate future work.  This document does not attempt to
   provide a detailed description of all the architectural components,
   but rather it describes a set of building blocks, requirements,
   architecture and guidelines from which models may be constructed.</p>
