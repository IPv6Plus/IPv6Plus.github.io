<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-bfd-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-bfd-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>This document describes the extensions to the PCEP to notify BFD
   parameters for LSPs from PCE to PCC for PCE-initiated LSP.  The
   extensions include BFD protocol parameters and allow PCC to support
   BFD for PCE-Initiated LSP whose BFD session is a bi-directional co-
   routed channel.</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support PCE-
   initiated IP Tunnel to satisfy the requirement which is introduced in
   [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment].  The extensions include the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated IP Tunnels, without the
   need for local configuration on the PCC.</p>

<p><strong>1. PCEP Link-State extensions for Segment Routing</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2015-11</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-pcep-ls-sr-extension-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-pcep-ls-sr-extension-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Segment Routing leverages source routing.  A node steers a packet
   through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.</p>

<p>IGP protocols have been extended to advertise the segments.  Because
   of IGP’s propagation scope limitation, it is not suited for IGP to
   signal paths that span across AS borders.  This document introduces
   extensions of PCEP-LS to solve the problem without the similar
   limitation.</p>

<p><strong>1. PCEP Procedures and Protocol Extensions for Using PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) of LSPs</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF WG Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2018-11</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.
   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  But SDN has a
   broader applicability than signaled (G)MPLS traffic-engineered (TE)
   networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of
   use cases.  PCEP has been proposed as a control protocol for use in
   these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central
   controller.
   A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be
   calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also
   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies
   as much as possible.
   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   for using the PCE as the central controller.</p>

<p><strong>2. PCEP Procedures and Protocol Extensions for Using PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) of SR-LSPs</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2017-06</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would
   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and
   GMPLS while removing the complexity of existing signalling protocols
   such as LDP and RSVP-TE.  PCE has been proposed to be used as a
   central controller (PCECC) so that LSP can be calculated/setup/
   initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through a
   centralized PCE server to each network devices along the path while
   leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.
   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   when the PCE functions as one of the central controller components in
   Segment Routing(SR).</p>

<p><strong>3. PCEP Procedures and Protocol Extensions for Using PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) for P2MP LSPs</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2018-10</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.
   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the
   determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).
   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS P2MP LSPs, which are
   supplied to the head end (root) of the LSP using PCEP.  PCEP has been
   proposed as a control protocol to allow the PCE to be fully enabled
   as a central controller.
   A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the P2MP LSP can
   be calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can
   also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   devices along the P2MP path while leveraging the existing PCE
   technologies as much as possible.
   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   for using the PCE as the central controller for P2MP TE LSP.</p>

<p><strong>4. PCE Controlled ID Space</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF Individual Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2018-06</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-controlled-id-space-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-li-pce-controlled-id-space-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths
   in SR networks.
   Stateful PCE provide active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a
   model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally
   configured LSPs to the PCE.  Further, stateful PCE could also create
   and delete PCE-initiated LSPs itself.  A PCE-based central controller
   (PCECC) simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by
   blending it with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.
   In some use cases, such as PCECC, Binding Segment Identifier (SID),
   SR Path Identification, there is a requirement for a stateful PCE to
   make allocation of labels, SID, Path-ID respectively.  These use
   cases require for the PCE to be aware of the various identifier space
   from which to make allocations on behalf of PCC.  This documents
   specify a mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier
   space under its control via PCEP.  The identifier could be MPLS
   label, SID, Path ID or another future identifier to be allocated by a
   PCE.</p>

<h2 id="pce-flowspec">PCE Flowspec</h2>

<p><strong>1. PCEP Extension for Flow Specification</strong></p>

<p>Publication: IETF WG Draft</p>

<p>Publication History: 2018-03</p>

<p>Publication URL: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec-00</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
   of selecting the paths through a traffic engineered network.  These
   paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may
   be unsolicited directions issued by the PCE to network elements.
   Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey
   the details of the computed path.</p>

<p>Traffic flows may be categorized and described using “Flow
   Specifications”.  RFC 5575 defines the Flow Specification and
   describes how it may be distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic
   flows to be associated with routes.</p>

<p>This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
   dissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate
   what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.</p>
